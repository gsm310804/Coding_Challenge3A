Customer_Records_Tracker_3A
Hi! This project is a Customer Records Tracker that keeps track of customer names, emails, and the items they purchase. The purpose of this program is to show how businesses can organize and manage customer information using arrays and objects in JavaScript. This is important because companies need a simple way to store, update, and review customer data so they can understand buying patterns and keep accurate records.
